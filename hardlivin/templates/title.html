			Hard Livin' is a life-sized board game that will fill Hashtag's walls with over
			500 unique pieces of hand-painted pixel art. Experience this larger-than-life obstacle
			course as you discover the trials and triumphs of a game that explores the state of
			mind a person may experience while manouvering through a difficult period in their life.
			Your survival depends on the choices you make and your ability to discover patterns and
			adopt strategies. Succeed, and you could win a prize graciously donated by one of our
			generous sponsorsâ€”A&amp;C Games, Snakes &amp; Lattes, Snakes &amp; Lagers,
			and Guerilla Printing.
